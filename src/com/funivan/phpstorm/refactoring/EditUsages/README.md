# Edit Usages

## Why?
Find usages is one of the powerful feature of PhpStorm. With this plugin you can export all usages to the file, edit it and apply changes to all files.
How I do that: find usages (for example find some method call), `create custom patch`, edit this patch with (I'm using multiple cursors, multiple selections etc) then I just apply this chagnes with action `apply custom patch`
Wery fast and simple way to edit your code.


## How to use
1. Run `find usages`
2. Focus on the usages panel
3. Invoke `Create patch from usages` action or invoke context menu on usages and select `Create custom patch`
4. Edit patch
5. Invoke `Apply custom patch` action
6. Check changes

## Demo

For better performance set hotkeys for two actions: `Create custom patch` and `Apply custom patch`
